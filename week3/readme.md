# Overview
## problem 1
Please write a program that reads a list of numbers with an integer type and counts how many times each number appears. You should note that the number of entries is not limited, your program should try to handle that. 
The output is a two-column table sorted descending by the number's count value. The first column is the list of all numbers, and the second column is the count of each of them. 

Input:
For the array values: –12 3 –12 4 1 1 –12 1 –1 1 2 3 4 2 3 –12

Output:
N Count
4 2
3 3
2 2
1 4
–1 1
–12 4
The two integers are divided by one tab(\t).
