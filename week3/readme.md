# Overview
## problem 1
Please write a program that reads a list of numbers with an integer type and counts how many times each number appears. You should note that the number of entries is not limited, your program should try to handle that. 
The output is a two-column table sorted descending by the number's count value. The first column is the list of all numbers, and the second column is the count of each of them. 

Input:
For the array values: –12 3 –12 4 1 1 –12 1 –1 1 2 3 4 2 3 –12

Output:
N Count
4 2
3 3
2 2
1 4
–1 1
–12 4
The two integers are divided by one tab(\t).

## problem 2
You are asked to generate a text-based histogram for a quiz of students. The quiz is graded on a scale from 0 to 5. Please design a program that allows the user to enter the student's grades one by one and count the times of each grade appears. 
When the input finished, please print the text-based histogram with the format in the "Output" section below. 
The program should be capable of handling an arbitrary number of student grades. 
 
輸入說明（Input）：Input filename:grade.txt
if the input grades are 
3 0 1 3 3 5 5 4 5 4 
輸出說明（Ouput）：Output filename:grades.Output
the program should output
1 grade(s) of 0
1 grade(s) of 1
0 grade(s) of 2
3 grade(s) of 3
2 grade(s) of 4
3 grade(s) of 5
