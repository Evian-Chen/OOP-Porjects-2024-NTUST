# Overview
## problem 1
Write a function that computes the average and standard deviation of input scores. The standard deviation is defined to be the square root of the average of the input values: 
(s_i - m)^2, where m is the average of the input scores s_i , i= 1, …, n.
Note that the number of input scores should be dynamic.

input：The first input is n, others are s_i, where i = 1 to n.

output：Output the Average and Standard deviation, separated by a tab.
