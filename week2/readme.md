# Overview
## problem 1
Write a function that computes the average and standard deviation of input scores. The standard deviation is defined to be the square root of the average of the input values: 
(s_i - m)^2, where m is the average of the input scores s_i , i= 1, …, n.
Note that the number of input scores should be dynamic.

input：The first input is n, others are s_i, where i = 1 to n.

output：Output the Average and Standard deviation, separated by a tab.

## problem 2
Consider a text file named scores.txt that contains player scores for a game. A possible sample is shown next where Ronaldo’s best score is 10400, Didier’s best score is 9800, etc. Put at least five names and scores in the file.

Ronaldo
10400
Didier
9800
Pele
12300
Kaka
8400
Cristiano
8000

Write a function named getHighScores that takes two array parameters, an array of strings and an array of integers. The function should scan through the file and set the string array entry at index 0 to the name of the player with the highest score and set the integer array entry at index 0 to the score of the player with the highest score. The string array entry at index 1 should be set to the name of the player with the second highest score and the integer array entry at index 1 should be set to the score of the player with the second highest score. Do the same for the entries at index 2. Together, these two arrays give you the names and scores of the top three players. In your main function, test the getHighScores function by calling it and outputting the top three players and scores.
Input:
Given an input file “scores.txt” which contains player’s scores for a game.
Output:
Output the names and scores of top three players.

## problem 3
The input messages of each line are English characters without spaces. Try to put the characters into a n*n square. Note that (n-1)^2 < message length <= n^2.

Input:
Input a string without whitespace.

Output:
The coded message is obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.
